Peter Meth will be presenting his PHP Tek 2025 talks on microservices:

---
Transitioning from monolithic PHP applications to a microservices architecture can be a game-changer, unlocking greater scalability, flexibility, and resilience.

This talk will explore not only the technical steps but also the transformative impact on team dynamics. By decentralizing services, teams can work more autonomously, fostering faster development cycles and greater ownership.

Drawing on over 20 years of PHP experience, I’ll cover essential elements of microservices—from decomposition and data management to deployment strategies. We’ll examine real-world examples, common pitfalls, and effective solutions to equip PHP developers with the tools and strategies needed to confidently transition to microservices.

Key Takeaways:
1. Understanding the core technical and team dynamics benefits of microservices architecture in PHP.

2. Techniques for decomposing a monolithic application into manageable services, leading to more focused team ownership and accountability.

3. Best practices for inter-service communication, data consistency, and monitoring to enable smoother team collaboration.

4. Insights on avoiding common microservices pitfalls, such as over-engineering and excessive interdependencies, to keep teams aligned and efficient.
